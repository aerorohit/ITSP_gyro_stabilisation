    * 
    * The high pass filter has three modes:
    *    Reset: The filter output settles to zero within one sample. This
    *           effectively disables the high pass filter. This mode may be toggled

    *
    *    Hold:  When triggered, the filter holds the present sample. The filter
    *           output will be the difference between the input sample and the held
    *           sample.

    * datasheet in the GYRO_CONFIG and ACCEL_CONFIG register descriptions (sections 4.4 
    * and 4.5 on pages 14 and 15). The scale of each depends on the sensitivity settings 
    * chosen, which can be one of +/- 2, 4, 8, or 16g for the accelerometer and one of 
    * +/- 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 deg/sec for the gyroscope. The accelerometer produces data 
    * in units of acceleration (distance over time2), and the gyroscope produces data in units
    * of rotational velocity (rotation distance over time).
    * 
    * The output scale for any setting is [-32768, +32767] for each of the six axes. The default 
    * setting in the I2Cdevlib class is +/- 2g for the accel and +/- 250 deg/sec for the gyro. If 
    * the device is perfectly level and not moving, then:
    * 		X/Y accel axes should read 0
    * 		Z accel axis should read 1g, which is +16384 at a sensitivity of 2g
    * 		X/Y/Z gyro axes should read 0
    * 
    * In reality, the accel axes won't read exactly 0 since it is difficult to be perfectly level 
    * and there is some noise/error, and the gyros will also not read exactly 0 for the same reason
    * (noise/error).
